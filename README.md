# Recommendations-with-IBM
Udacity DSND Project on building a recommendation system using the IBM Watson Studio platform.

#### Enviroment: Using jupyter notebooks,python 3

Libraries used:

1- Pandas

2- Matplotlib 

3- Sklearn

4- Pandas

5- Pickle

#### My project is divided into following tasks:

I. Exploratory Data Analysis

We will need to explore the data we are working with for the project,and provide a visual and descriptive statistics.


II. Rank Based Recommendations

Here we will first find the most popular articles simply based on the most interactions. Since there are no ratings for any of the articles, it is easy to assume the articles with the most interactions are the most popular. 

   
III. User-User Based Collaborative Filtering

 We are  looking  at users that are similar in terms of the items they have interacted with. These items could then be recommended to the similar users.
 
 
IV. Matrix Factorization

Finally, I  am using   a machine learning approach to build recommendations. Using the user-item interactions, I am building  out a matrix decomposition.  Using our decomposition, we will get an idea of how well we can predict new articles an individual might interact with .


#### Conclusion

Finally after all the  tasks , we will get the recommendations by applying differnt methods of recommendations.
The main findings of the code can be found at the [repo](https://github.com/VenkteshSahu22/Recommendations-with-IBM/) available here.
